# ComeOverNikuhost

This simple project emulates a functioning website hosting platform.

It's basically a HTML/CSS implementation that leverages the power of flexbox, css grid, mediaqueries, and animation
to create a modern-looking UI that has an aesthetic that is pleasing to the eye.

Who knows, maybe it'll be intergrated to a robust NestJS backend and be a fully functional platform that developers and others alike can host
their works completely for free, lol.
